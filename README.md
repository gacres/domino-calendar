# BASICS

As with other repositories
- README.md (using markdown) is in the root of the repo. NOTICE.md should also be added here if required.
- .git folder for all the Git-related stuff
- notes folder for the NSF
- documentation folder

## Editing the ReadMe
The ReadMe file can be edited in NotePad or Brackets or Atom or whatever. Look on teh web for standards around markdown, e.g. [Daring Fireball blog] (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
